In this letter, we want to point out that it is very easy to draw poor conclusions from a common heuristic, the "elbow method". Better alternatives have been known in literature for a long time, and we want to draw attention to some of these easy to use options, that often perform better. This letter is a call to stop using the elbow method altogether, because it severely lacks theoretic support, and we want to encourage educators to discuss the problems of the method - if introducing it in class at all - and teach alternatives instead, while researchers and reviewers should reject conclusions drawn from the elbow method.},

We compare the approximation ratio of these algorithms as a function of the total size of the input items α. We give a complete analysis of the worst case behavior of WF and NF, and determine the ranges of α for which FF has a smaller approximation ratio than WF and NF. In addition, we prove a new upper bound of 127≈1.7143 on the absolute approximation ratio of FF, improving over the previously known upper bound of 1.75, given by Simchi-Levi. This property of FF is in contrast to the absolute approximation ratios of WF and NF, which are both equal to 2.}

When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program. The recently developed genetic programming paradigm described herein provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve (or approximately solve) a surprising variety of different problems from different fields. In genetic programming, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (sexual recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. Genetic programming is illustrated via an example of machine learning of the Boolean 11-multiplexer function and symbolic regression of the econometric exchange equation from noisy empirical data.},

We prove that also the absolute approximation ratio for BestFit bin packing is exactly 1.7, improving the previous bound of 1.75. This means that if the optimum needs Opt bins, BestFit always uses at most {\$}{\backslash}lfloor1.7{\backslash}cdot{\$}OPT{\$}{\backslash}rfloor{\$}bins. Furthermore we show matching lower bounds for all values of Opt, i.e., we give instances on which BestFit uses exactly {\$}{\backslash}lfloor1.7{\backslash}cdot{\$}OPT{\$}{\backslash}rfloor{\$}bins. Thus we completely settle the worst-case complexity of BestFit bin packing after more than 40 years of its study.},

  abstract  = {Consider an optimization problem with n binary variables and d+1 linear objective functions. Each valid solution x ∈{0,1}n gives rise to an objective vector in Rd+1, and one often wants to enumerate the Pareto optima among them. In the worst case there may be exponentially many Pareto optima; however, it was recently shown that in (a generalization of) the smoothed analysis framework, the expected number is polynomial in~n. Unfortunately, the bound obtained had a rather bad dependence on d; roughly ndd. In this paper we show a significantly improved bound of n2d.Our proof is based on analyzing two algorithms. The first algorithm, on input a Pareto optimal x, outputs a "testimony" containing clues about x's objective vector, x's coordinates, and the region of space B in which x's objective vector lies. The second algorithm can be regarded as a speculative execution of the first --- it can uniquely reconstruct x from the testimony's clues and just some of the probability space's outcomes. The remainder of the probability space's outcomes are just enough to bound the probability that x's objective vector falls into the region B.},
